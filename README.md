# my-react-portfolio

## Description
A simple Portfolio template for developer/designers built with React, which is used to showcase my work, testimonials and other information to clients and potential employers. Now that I've worked with React and have multiple projects to share, I've updated my portfolio to reflect the newly learned technologies.
